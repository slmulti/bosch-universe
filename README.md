I love the Harry Bosch books written by Micheal Connelly. The problem is that he has written so many over so many years with different characters each having their own mini series within a series and its hard to keep track of the chronological order to read them in. This app is designed to do this. To track the books I own(because i only buy them when they are on sale), the books ive read and to add books as and when they are released.
